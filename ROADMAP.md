#### Payment API

> This milestone will be done when
* All backends are selected (likely express / next, coupled with an SQL DB)
* An accounts system is in place (with tokenization)
* An API is made to serve all data needed for the wallet, including balance
* The API is linked to the Conflux network

This will allow us to then move on to developing the wallet.
